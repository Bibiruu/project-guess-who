# Project Name

Created a guess who game, where a player will be guessing the secret person.

## The problem

The plan at first was to get familiar with the given draft. Checked where I could use possible loops, functions and in built functions. Took a longer time to make the filtering work correctly. Checked different options how to excecute this. 

If I had more time I would try to find a way to write some of the codes differently. Even shorter, precise.
